    "section_content": "Alright, let's get started with the layout of a golf course. Typically, a golf course consists of 18 holes, though smaller courses with 9 holes are also common. Ever wondered why? Legend has it that St Andrews, one of the oldest and most prestigious golf courses, initially had 12 holes. However, some were too short and thus got combined, leaving 10. Players would play the course twice, resulting in 20 holes. Later, members decided that two of these were too short and eliminated them, resulting in the standard 18 holes we see today. Interesting, isn't it? Now, each golf course is unique, with its own set of challenges. The terrain can vary drastically - from flat to hilly, with trees, bodies of water, and sand traps in different places. This adds to the thrill and challenge of the game, ensuring no two rounds of golf are ever the same. Now, onto the rating system. The difficulty of a golf course is assessed through a rating system that takes into account factors like length, obstacles, and the playing conditions. This helps in comparing scores between different courses. A lower course rating indicates a less challenging course, while a higher rating signifies a more difficult course. Understanding the layout, terrain, and rating system of a golf course truly enhances one's appreciation of the game. It's not just about hitting a little white ball, but strategizing and adapting to the unique challenges presented by each course.",

These rules serve as a framework for conducting satyagraha in a disciplined and principled manner. \n\nThe first rule is to harbor no anger, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a calm and peaceful mindset throughout the campaign. Satyagrahis are encouraged to suffer the anger of their opponents without retaliating, demonstrating their commitment to nonviolence. They are also advised to never retaliate to assaults or punishment, even if provoked, and to willingly submit to arrest or confiscation of their own property.\n\nAnother important rule is to defend property non-violently, highlighting the satyagrahis' commitment to nonviolent resistance even in the face of potential harm or loss. They are instructed not to curse or swear, and to refrain from insulting the opponent. Additionally, satyagrahis are advised to neither salute nor insult the flag of their opponent or their opponent's leaders, showing respect while maintaining their own principles.\n\nFurthermore, satyagrahis are encouraged to defend their opponents non-violently if they are insulted or assaulted, demonstrating their commitment to nonviolence even towards those who oppose them. They are also expected to behave courteously and obey prison regulations if they are arrested, without asking for special treatment. Satyagrahis are advised not to fast in an attempt to gain conveniences that do not involve injury to their self-respect, and to joyfully obey the orders of the leaders of the civil disobedience action.\n\nThese rules for satyagraha campaigns provide a clear framework for conducting nonviolent resistance in a disciplined and principled manner. By adhering to these guidelines, satyagrahis demonstrate their commitment to nonviolence, truth, and justice, and inspire others to join their cause. These principles and practices have not only influenced the Indian independence movement but have also inspired numerous other social justice movements around the world."}]

When our eyes are in direct contact with water, light entering the eye is refracted by a different angle, making it unable to focus on the retina. However, by wearing a diving mask, an airspace is created in front of the eyes, allowing them to focus nearly normally. The shape of the air space in the mask slightly affects the ability to focus, and corrective lenses can be added to the inside surface of the mask to improve vision for those with focusing defects.\n\nOne of the key functions of a diving mask is to counteract the refraction of light that occurs when entering water. Light rays entering the mask refract, or bend, as they pass through the water and the flat parallel window of the mask. This refraction makes objects appear about 34% bigger and 25% nearer when underwater. Additionally, pincushion distortion and lateral chromatic aberration may be noticeable. As the diver descends in clean water, the water acts as a color filter, eliminating the red end of the visible spectrum and leaving only the blue end. This is why artificial light sources are often necessary for clear visibility underwater.\n\nThe construction of diving masks varies, but they generally consist of a durable, tempered glass faceplate or two lenses in front of the eyes. The lenses may be supported by a plastic or metal frame or permanently bonded to the skirt in a frameless design. The skirt, usually made of synthetic rubber or silicone elastomer, creates a watertight seal with the diver's face. The skirt also encloses the nose, allowing the diver to exhale through the nose into the mask to equalize the internal pressure during descent and avoid barotrauma. The mask is held in place by an elastomer strap or an expanded neoprene pad with Velcro straps.\n\nOverall, diving masks play a crucial role in allowing underwater divers, including scuba divers, free-divers, and snorkelers, to see clearly underwater. By creating an airspace in front of the eyes and counteracting the refraction of light, diving masks enable divers to explore the underwater world with improved vision and clarity."}]

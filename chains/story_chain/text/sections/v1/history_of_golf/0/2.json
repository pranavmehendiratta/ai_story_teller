But it's not limited to Scotland for long. The game quickly spreads across the British Isles, and soon, to the rest of the world. Why did golf become such a hit? Well, let's find out. \n\nGolf was a game that could be played by anyone, regardless of social class. This made it widely accessible and played a key role in its spread. Its popularity in Scotland was such that the Scottish monarchy even tried to ban it in the 15th and 16th centuries, fearing it was distracting people from archery practice. However, this did little to dampen the public's enthusiasm for the sport. \n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, golf crossed the Atlantic to the United States, brought by Scottish immigrants. The first recorded instance of golf in the US is from 1650, when a pair of Scottish merchants began hitting balls in an open field. The game caught on quickly, and by the late 19th century, there were hundreds of golf courses across the country. \n\nFrom there, golf continued to spread globally, thanks in part to the British Empire's global reach. Today, golf is played in over 200 countries, and major tournaments are watched by millions around the world. \n\nSo, we've traced the journey of golf from a local pastime in Scotland to a global phenomenon. But as the game spread and grew, so did its equipment. In fact, the evolution of golf equipment is a fascinating story in its own right, and that's what we'll be exploring in our next section. So stay tuned!",

    "next_section_opening": "As we've seen, golf has traveled far and wide, ingraining itself in cultures across the globe. But as the game spread, so did the need for better, more efficient equipment. Let's rewind a bit, back to the early days of golf in Scotland. Picture this - players using wooden clubs to hit feather-stuffed balls. Sound primitive? Well, that was the reality back then. But over the centuries, golf equipment has evolved dramatically. In the next section, we'll delve into the evolution of golf equipment, from the humble wooden clubs and featheries of yesteryears to the high-tech equipment we see today. So, stick around, you won't want to miss this!"

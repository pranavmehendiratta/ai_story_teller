The background and events leading to the partition of India are complex and multifaceted. The partition was outlined in the Indian Independence Act 1947, which resulted in the division of British India into two independent dominions: India and Pakistan.\n\nThe partition of India resulted in the division of political borders and the division of other assets, including the division of two provinces of British India, Bengal and Punjab. The majority Muslim districts in these provinces were awarded to Pakistan, while the majority non-Muslim districts were awarded to India. The partition also led to the division of other assets such as the British Indian Army, the Royal Indian Navy, the Royal Indian Air Force, the Indian Civil Service, the railways, and the central treasury.\n\nThe partition of India caused large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration between the two dominions. It is estimated that between 14 million and 18 million people moved, and perhaps more. The violent nature of the partition created an atmosphere of hostility and suspicion between India and Pakistan that affects their relationship to this day.\n\nIt is important to note that the term partition of India does not cover the separation of Burma (Myanmar) from the British Raj in 1937 or the much earlier separation of Ceylon (Sri Lanka) from the rule of the East India Company in 1796. Other political entities or transformations in the region that were not a part of the partition were the political integration of princely states into the two new dominions, the annexation of the princely states of Hyderabad and Junagadh by India, the dispute and division of the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir between India, Pakistan, and later China, and the incorporation of the enclaves of French India into India during the period 1947\u20131954.\n\nOverall, the background and events leading to the partition of India were complex and resulted in significant political, social, and demographic changes in the region. The partition caused large-scale migration, loss of life, and created an atmosphere of hostility between India and Pakistan that continues to impact their relationship today."}]

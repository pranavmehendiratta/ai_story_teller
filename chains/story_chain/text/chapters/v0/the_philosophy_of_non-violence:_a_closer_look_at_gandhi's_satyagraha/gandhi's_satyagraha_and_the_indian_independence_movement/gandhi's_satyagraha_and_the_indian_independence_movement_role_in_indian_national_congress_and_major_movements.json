Gandhi's role in the Indian National Congress was significant as he became one of its prominent leaders and played a crucial role in shaping its policies and strategies.\n\nUnder Gandhi's leadership, the Indian National Congress adopted nonviolent methods of resistance and civil disobedience as a means to challenge British rule and fight for India's independence. The Non-Cooperation Movement, launched in 1920, was a major campaign that aimed to boycott British institutions, including schools, courts, and government offices. This movement gained widespread support and participation from the Indian masses, showcasing the power of nonviolent resistance in mobilizing the people and challenging colonial authority.\n\nAnother significant movement led by Gandhi was the Salt March, also known as the Dandi March, which took place in 1930. This movement was a protest against the British monopoly on salt production and distribution. Gandhi and his followers marched for 240 miles to the coastal town of Dandi, where they illegally produced salt by evaporating seawater. The Salt March gained international attention and highlighted the unjust and oppressive nature of British rule in India.\n\nCivil Disobedience was another major movement led by Gandhi, which aimed to challenge British laws and policies through nonviolent means. This movement involved acts of noncooperation, such as boycotting British goods, refusing to pay taxes, and participating in peaceful protests and demonstrations. Civil Disobedience was a powerful tool in mobilizing the Indian masses and putting pressure on the British government to address the demands of the Indian people.\n\nOverall, this section highlights Gandhi's pivotal role in the Indian National Congress and his leadership in major movements that played a crucial role in India's struggle for independence. Gandhi's commitment to nonviolence and his ability to mobilize the masses through peaceful means were instrumental in shaping the course of the Indian independence movement and inspiring similar movements for civil rights and freedom around the world."}, {"topic": "The Philosophy of Non-Violence: A Closer Look at Gandhi's Satyagraha", "chapter_name": "Gandhi's Satyagraha and the Indian Independence Movement", "section_name": "Role in Indian National Congress and Major Movements", "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_independence_movement_part_1", "section_summary": "In the section titled \"Role in Indian National Congress and Major Movements,\" we delve into Gandhi's involvement in the Indian National Congress and his leadership in major movements such as the Non-Cooperation Movement, the Salt March, and Civil Disobedience.

This day holds great importance in India as it is celebrated as a national holiday and is observed in all states and territories. The United Nations General Assembly also recognized the significance of Gandhi's non-violent approach and declared 2 October as the International Day of Non-Violence.\n\nGandhi Jayanti is marked by various activities and tributes across the country. Prayer services and commemorative ceremonies take place, particularly at Raj Ghat in New Delhi, where Gandhi was cremated. Additionally, colleges, local government institutions, and socio-political organizations organize prayer meetings, essay competitions, painting competitions, and Mahatma Gandhi quiz competitions. These events aim to promote a nonviolent way of life and honor Gandhi's contributions to the Indian independence movement.\n\nOne of the notable aspects of Gandhi Jayanti is the singing of Gandhi's favorite Bhajan, \"Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram,\" as a tribute to him. Statues of Mahatma Gandhi are adorned with flowers and garlands throughout the country, symbolizing reverence and respect. Some individuals also choose to abstain from consuming alcohol or eating meat on this day as a mark of respect.\n\nThe significance of Gandhi Jayanti extends beyond commemoration. It is a day when awards are granted for projects promoting nonviolence in schools and communities. In 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi initiated the Swachh Bharat Mission on Gandhi Jayanti, emphasizing the importance of cleanliness and sanitation. This mission has since become a nationwide campaign.\n\nOverall, Gandhi Jayanti serves as a platform to honor Mahatma Gandhi's principles of nonviolence, his tireless efforts for independence, and his role as the \"Father of The Nation.\" It is a day of reflection, remembrance, and inspiration for individuals across India and around the world."}]

It begins by discussing the purpose and function of in-space propulsion, which includes primary propulsion, reaction control, station keeping, precision pointing, and orbital maneuvering. The main engines used in space provide the primary propulsive force for orbit transfer, planetary trajectories, and extra-planetary landing and ascent. The section also explains that the purpose of a propulsion system is to change the velocity of a spacecraft, and designers generally discuss spacecraft performance in terms of specific impulse, which is the amount of change in momentum per unit of propellant consumed.\n\nThe section then delves into the different operating domains of spacecraft propulsion. It explains that spacecraft operate in orbital, interplanetary, and interstellar domains. In the orbital domain, spacecraft use onboard propulsion systems for orbital stationkeeping, attitude control, and orbit maintenance. In the interplanetary domain, spacecraft use engines to leave Earth's orbit and make their way to their destination. The section mentions the use of Hohmann transfer orbits and other trajectory adjustments for interplanetary travel. In the interstellar domain, the section highlights the challenges of achieving high velocities for interstellar travel and mentions hypothetical propulsion technologies that have been proposed for such missions.\n\nNext, the section explores the different propulsion technologies used in spacecraft. It categorizes these technologies into four groups: chemical propulsion, electric propulsion, advanced propulsion technologies, and supporting technologies. Chemical propulsion, which uses chemical reactions to create a hot gas for thrust, is the most common type of propulsion used in rockets. Electric propulsion, on the other hand, uses electrostatic or electromagnetic forces to accelerate ions or other charged particles to high exhaust velocities. The section provides examples of electric propulsion technologies such as ion thrusters and Hall-effect thrusters. Advanced propulsion technologies, which are still in the theoretical or experimental stage, are also discussed briefly.\n\nThe section concludes by mentioning the testing of spacecraft propulsion systems. It explains that these systems are often tested on Earth's surface, either statically or in vacuum chambers. Rocket engines are tested at dedicated rocket engine test facilities, while ion drives require vacuum chambers for testing. The section also mentions the use of test launches at rocket launch sites for some systems.\n\nOverall, this section provides a comprehensive overview of spacecraft propulsion, covering its purpose and function, operating domains, propulsion technologies, and testing methods. It highlights the importance of propulsion systems in enabling space exploration and discusses both current and hypothetical technologies that are used or proposed for spacecraft propulsion."}]

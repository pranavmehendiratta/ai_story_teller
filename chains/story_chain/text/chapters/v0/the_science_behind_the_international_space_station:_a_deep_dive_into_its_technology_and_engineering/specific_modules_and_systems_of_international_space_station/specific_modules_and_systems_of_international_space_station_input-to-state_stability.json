It is a property that characterizes the behavior of a control system in the presence of disturbances or uncertainties. In ISS, a control system is globally asymptotically stable in the absence of external inputs and its trajectories are bounded by a function of the size of the input for all sufficiently large times.\n\nThe importance of ISS lies in its ability to bridge the gap between input-output and state-space methods, which are widely used in the control systems community. It unifies the Lyapunov and input-output stability theories and revolutionizes our view on stabilization of nonlinear systems, design of robust nonlinear observers, stability of nonlinear interconnected control systems, nonlinear detectability theory, and supervisory adaptive control. ISS has become the dominating stability paradigm in nonlinear control theory, with applications in robotics, mechatronics, systems biology, electrical and aerospace engineering, among others.\n\nIn this section, we will discuss the definition of ISS and its characterizations. ISS is defined for a time-invariant system of ordinary differential equations with external inputs. It is a property that ensures the system is globally asymptotically stable in the absence of external inputs and its trajectories are bounded by a function of the size of the input for all sufficiently large times. The definition of ISS is based on the concept of comparison functions, which are continuous increasing functions that bound the trajectories of the system.\n\nWe will also discuss the characterizations of the input-to-state stability property. These characterizations provide alternative ways to check whether a system is ISS. One of the characterizations is based on the notion of globally asymptotic stability (GAS), which states that a system is ISS if it is globally asymptotically stable at zero and its trajectories are bounded by a function of the size of the input. Another characterization is based on the concept of Lyapunov gain, which measures the rate at which the Lyapunov function decreases along the trajectories of the system.\n\nIn addition to the definition and characterizations, we will also discuss ISS-Lyapunov functions, which are important tools for verifying ISS. An ISS-Lyapunov function is a smooth function that satisfies certain conditions and provides a measure of the system's stability. It is used to establish the stability of the system by showing that the derivative of the Lyapunov function is negative along the trajectories of the system.\n\nFurthermore, we will explore the interconnections of ISS systems. One of the main features of the ISS framework is the ability to study the stability properties of interconnected systems. We will discuss cascade interconnections, where the dynamics of the subsystems do not depend on the states of the other subsystems. We will also discuss feedback interconnections, where the interconnection structure of the subsystems is characterized by the internal Lyapunov gains. We will present a small-gain theorem that provides a sufficient condition for ISS of the interconnection of ISS systems.\n\nFinally, we will touch upon ISS of time-delay systems and ISS of other classes of systems. ISS theory has been extended to time-delay systems, where the state of the system depends on past values of the input and the state. We will discuss the conditions for ISS of time-delay systems and the different Lyapunov-type sufficient conditions that have been proposed. We will also briefly mention the ISS theory for other classes of systems, such as time-variant ordinary differential equation systems and hybrid systems.\n\nIn conclusion, input-to-state stability is a powerful stability notion that has revolutionized the field of nonlinear control theory. It provides a unified framework for studying the stability of nonlinear control systems with external inputs and has diverse applications in various fields of engineering. The definition, characterizations, and interconnections of ISS systems provide valuable tools for analyzing and designing stable control systems. The ISS theory for time-delay systems and other classes of systems further extends the applicability of ISS to a wide range of practical systems."}]

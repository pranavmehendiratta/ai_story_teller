The Kib\u014d module, developed by JAXA, is the largest single module of the ISS and is attached to the Harmony module.\n\nThe section begins by discussing the components of the Kib\u014d module. It consists of the Pressurized Module (PM), Exposed Facility (EF), Experiment Logistics Module (ELM) Pressurized Section (ELM-PS), Experiment Logistics Module (ELM) Exposed Section (ELM-ES), Japanese Experiment Module remote manipulator system (JEMRMS), and Inter-orbit communication system (ICS). The PM is the core component and contains International Standard Payload Racks (ISPRs) for science experiments and system storage. The EF is located outside the PM and provides ports for experiment payloads fully exposed to the space environment. The ELM consists of a pressurized section for storage and an unpressurized section for transportation.\n\nNext, the launch sequence of the Kib\u014d module is described. The module was launched in three separate flights using the Space Shuttle. The Experiment Logistics Module-Pressurized Section (ELM-PS) was launched on the STS-123 mission, followed by the Pressurized Module (PM) on the STS-124 mission, and finally the Exposed Facility (EF) and Experiment Logistics Module-External Section (ELM-ES) on the STS-127 mission.\n\nThe specifications of the Kib\u014d module are then provided. The PM has a length of 11.19 meters, a diameter of 4.39 meters, and a mass of 15,900 kilograms. The ELM-PS has a length of 4.21 meters, a diameter of 4.39 meters, and a mass of 8,386 kilograms. The EF has a length of 4 meters, a diameter of 5.6 meters, a height of 5 meters, and a mass of 4,000.685 kilograms. The module and its accessories were manufactured using stainless steel, titanium, and aluminum.\n\nLastly, the section discusses the experiments conducted on the Kib\u014d module. Current external experiments include MAXI for X-ray astronomy, OCO-3 for monitoring carbon dioxide, and NREP for nanoracks external platform, among others. Former external experiments include SMILES for observing trace gas molecules and MCE for multi-mission consolidated equipment. Internal experiments include fluid physics, cell biology, gradient heating furnace, and multi-purpose small payload racks.\n\nOverall, this section provides a comprehensive overview of the Japanese Experiment Module (Kib\u014d), highlighting its components, launch sequence, specifications, and the various experiments conducted on the module."}]

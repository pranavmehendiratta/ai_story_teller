[{"summary_topic": "The role of Mahatma Gandhi in the Indian Independence Movement", "chapter_name": "Key Movements in the Struggle for Indian Independence", "section_topic": "The Quit India Movement", "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quit_India_Movement", "section_summary": "The Quit India Movement, also known as the Bharat Chhodo Andolan, was a movement launched by Mahatma Gandhi on 9 August 1942, demanding an end to British rule in India. The movement was a response to the failure of the British government to secure Indian support for the British war effort with the Cripps Mission. In his Quit India speech delivered in Bombay, Gandhi called for \"An Orderly British Withdrawal\" from India and made a call to Do or Die.\n\nThe movement was met with strong opposition from the British government, who swiftly arrested almost the entire leadership of the Indian National Congress without trial. The British had the support of various groups, including the Viceroy's Council, the All India Muslim League, the Hindu Mahasabha, the princely states, the Indian Imperial Police, the British Indian Army, and the Indian Civil Service. Many Indian businessmen who were profiting from wartime spending also did not support the movement.\n\nDespite the arrests and opposition, the Quit India Movement gained momentum and included boycotting the British government and rejecting transactions involving the government. Violent incidents took place across the country against the British regime. The British responded by arresting tens of thousands of leaders and keeping them imprisoned until 1945.\n\nThe movement ultimately ended in 1945 with the release of jailed freedom fighters. The martyrs of this freedom movement include Mukunda Kakati, Matangini Hazra, Kanaklata Barua, Kushal Konwar, Bhogeswari Phukanani, and others. In 1992, the Reserve Bank of India issued a 1 rupee commemorative coin to mark the Golden Jubilee of the Quit India Movement.\n\nThe Quit India Movement had a significant impact on the Indian independence struggle. It kept the Congress party united and galvanized large protests and demonstrations across the country. The British responded with mass detentions, fines, and violence, but the movement continued to gain support. The movement also led to the establishment of parallel governments in some areas and disrupted British military preparations during World War II.\n\nThe movement ended with the release of political prisoners in 1945, and the British government realized that India was ungovernable in the long run. The issue for the postwar era became how to exit gracefully and peacefully. The Quit India Movement played a crucial role in shaping the path towards Indian independence."}]

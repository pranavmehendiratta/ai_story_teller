We will also discuss other uses of snorkeling beyond recreational activities.\n\nSnorkeling, also known as snorkelling in British and Commonwealth English, is a popular recreational activity that involves swimming on or through a body of water while equipped with a diving mask, a snorkel, and swimfins. This equipment allows snorkelers to observe underwater attractions for extended periods with relatively little effort and to breathe while face-down at the surface. Snorkeling is particularly popular at tropical resort locations, as it provides the opportunity to observe underwater life in a natural setting without the need for complicated scuba diving equipment and training.\n\nThe appeal of snorkeling lies in its simplicity and accessibility. People of all ages can enjoy snorkeling due to the minimal effort required. It serves as the basis for the two surface disciplines of the underwater sport of finswimming. Snorkeling is also utilized by scuba divers when on the surface, as well as in underwater sports such as underwater hockey and underwater rugby. Additionally, it plays a role in water-based searches conducted by search and rescue teams.\n\nOverall, snorkeling offers a unique and immersive experience for individuals to explore the underwater world. It allows them to connect with nature, observe marine life, and enjoy the beauty of the ocean without the need for extensive training or equipment.

After completing his law studies in London, Gandhi moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit. It was in South Africa that Gandhi first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights. He experienced firsthand the racial discrimination faced by Indians and became determined to fight for their rights.\n\nIn South Africa, Gandhi raised a family and spent 21 years fighting for the rights of Indians. He organized protests against excessive land-tax and discrimination, and his efforts led to the formation of the Natal Indian Congress in 1894. Gandhi's time in South Africa also saw him actively participating in the Boer War, where he formed a volunteer ambulance corps and served as a stretcher-bearer.\n\nGandhi's experiences in South Africa shaped his beliefs and methods of resistance. He witnessed the power of nonviolent protest and civil disobedience, and he began to advocate for these methods in his fight for Indian independence. Gandhi returned to India in 1915 and assumed leadership of the Indian National Congress. He led nationwide campaigns for various causes, including easing poverty, expanding women's rights, and achieving self-rule.\n\nGandhi's time in London and South Africa played a crucial role in shaping his activism and his vision for an independent India. His experiences of discrimination and injustice fueled his determination to fight for the rights of Indians and to challenge British rule. Gandhi's use of nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience became powerful tools in his fight for Indian independence."}]

But as the game spread, so too did the need for better, more efficient equipment. Now, let's rewind a bit, back to the early days of golf in Scotland. Picture this - players using wooden clubs to hit feather-stuffed balls. Sound primitive? Well, that was the reality back then. But over the centuries, golf equipment has evolved dramatically. Early golf clubs were rudimentary at best, often carved from a single piece of wood. Golf balls, or 'featheries' as they were known, were made by stuffing a leather pouch with goose feathers. As you can imagine, these balls weren't particularly durable, and they were costly to produce. Over time, golf balls transitioned from leather and feather creations to the modern, rubber-based balls we see today. The invention of the gutta-percha ball in the mid-1800s, made from the sap of the Gutta tree, revolutionized the game, making it more accessible to the masses. Golf clubs too have seen massive changes. From wooden clubs, we moved to iron clubs in the late 1800s. These changes didn't stop there, as evolution continued with the advent of steel shafts in the 1920s to graphite shafts in the 1970s. Today, advancements in technology have led to high-tech equipment that enhances performance and makes the game more enjoyable. These transformations in golf equipment have not only changed the way the game is played but also how it's perceived. It's truly fascinating to see how far we've come from the rudimentary beginnings of wooden clubs and feather-stuffed balls.",

title: Input-to-State Stability
outline:
1. Definition
 - Consider a time-invariant system of ordinary differential equations
 - To define ISS and related properties, we exploit the following classes of comparison functions
 - System (1) is called globally asymptotically stable at zero (0-GAS) if the corresponding system with zero input
 - System (1) is called input-to-state stable (ISS) if there exist functions
 - Clearly, an ISS system is 0-GAS as well as BIBO stable
 - It can be also proved that if
 - The function
 - Consider a system
2. Characterizations of input-to-state stability property
 - For an understanding of ISS its restatements in terms of other stability properties are of great importance.
 - System (1) is called globally stable (GS) if there exist
 - System (1) satisfies the asymptotic gain (AG) property if there exists
 - The following statements are equivalent for sufficiently regular right-hand side
 - Other characterizations of ISS that are valid under very mild restrictions on the regularity of the rhs
 - ISS-Lyapunov functions
 - An important tool for the verification of ISS are ISS-Lyapunov functions.
 - An important result due to E. Sontag and Y. Wang is that a system (1) is ISS if and only if there exists a smooth ISS-Lyapunov function for it.
 - Examples
3. Interconnections of ISS systems
 - One of the main features of the ISS framework is the possibility to study stability properties of interconnections of input-to-state stable systems.
 - Cascade interconnections
 - Feedback interconnections
 - The interconnection structure of subsystems is characterized by the internal Lyapunov gains
 - The small-gain condition in this form is called also cyclic small-gain condition.
4. ISS of time-delay systems
 - Consider the time-invariant time-delay system
 - System (TDS) is ISS if and only if there exist functions
 - In the ISS theory for time-delay systems two different Lyapunov-type sufficient conditions have been proposed: via ISS Lyapunov-Razumikhin functions and by ISS Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals. For converse Lyapunov theorems for time-delay systems see.
5. ISS of other classes of systems
 - Input-to-state stability of the systems based on time-invariant ordinary differential equations is a quite developed theory, see a recent monograph. However, ISS theory of other classes of systems is also being investigated for time-variant ODE systems and hybrid systems. In the last time also certain generalizations of ISS concepts to infinite-dimensional systems have been proposed.

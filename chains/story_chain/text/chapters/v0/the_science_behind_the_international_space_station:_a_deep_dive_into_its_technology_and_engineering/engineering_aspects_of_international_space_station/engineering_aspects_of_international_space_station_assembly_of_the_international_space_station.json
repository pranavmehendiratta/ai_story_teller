[{"topic": "The Science Behind the International Space Station: A Deep Dive Into its Technology and Engineering", "chapter_name": "Engineering Aspects of International Space Station", "section_name": "Assembly of the International Space Station", "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_of_the_International_Space_Station_part_1", "section_summary": "The section titled \"Assembly of the International Space Station\" provides an overview of the process and logistics involved in constructing the ISS. The assembly of the ISS began in the 1990s with the launch of the first module, Zarya, followed by the Unity module. The initial core of the ISS remained uncrewed for one and a half years until the launch of the Russian module Zvezda, which allowed for a permanent crew of three astronauts or cosmonauts.\n\nThe ISS has a pressurized volume of approximately 1,000 cubic meters and a mass of approximately 410,000 kilograms. Building the complete station required more than 40 assembly flights, including 36 Space Shuttle flights and modules lifted by other rockets. The section lists some of the larger modules that have been added to the ISS, such as Zarya, Unity, Zvezda, Destiny Laboratory Module, Harmony Module, Columbus orbital facility, and the Japanese Experiment Module.\n\nThe section also discusses the logistics of the ISS, including its location in low Earth orbit and its orbit around the Earth. It mentions that the ISS completes more than 50,000 orbits since its launch. The section highlights the various spacecraft and vehicles that are used to deliver supplies, equipment, and crew to the ISS, including the Soyuz spacecraft, Progress transporters, SpaceX Dragon, European ATV, and Japanese HTV.\n\nThe section then delves into the impact of the Columbia disaster on the construction plans of the ISS. After the disaster, there was uncertainty over the future of the ISS, and the U.S. Space Shuttle program was suspended for two and a half years. Crew exchanges were carried out solely using the Russian Soyuz spacecraft during this period. The section also mentions the changes in construction plans that were made even before the Columbia disaster, including the cancellation or replacement of modules and a reduction in the number of Shuttle flights.\n\nThe assembly sequence of the ISS is outlined, highlighting the order in which the pressurized modules were added to the station. The section also mentions future elements that are planned for the ISS, such as the upgrade of the station's solar arrays and the addition of modules as part of the commercial Axiom Station project. It also lists the modules that were cancelled or unused in the construction of the ISS.\n\nOverall, this section provides a comprehensive overview of the assembly of the International Space Station, covering its logistics, changes in construction plans, assembly sequence, and future elements. It showcases the collaborative efforts and technological advancements involved in building and maintaining this remarkable feat of engineering in space."}]

    "section_content": "So, let's dive right into the history of golf. The origins of the sport can be traced back to the Roman game of paganica, where players used a bent stick to hit a stuffed leather ball. However, the game as we know it today, started to take shape in Scotland during the Middle Ages. Initially played on the eastern coast of Scotland, golf was a pastime for shepherds, who would hit stones into rabbit holes with their shepherd's crooks. The popularity of the game grew, and in the 15th century, it was even banned by King James II of Scotland, as it was distracting the archers from their practice. Thankfully, this ban was lifted in 1502, and golf flourished in Scotland. The first recorded golf tournament took place in 1567, and was won by Mary, Queen of Scots' son, King James IV. From Scotland, the game spread to England, and eventually to the rest of the world. The first golf club was established in 1744, the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers. The first known rules of golf were also drafted at this time. By the 19th century, golf had become widely popular and had spread to the United States. The first 18-hole golf course, the Chicago Golf Club, was established in 1893. Today, golf is played worldwide, and is recognized as a sport of precision, patience and strategic thinking. This journey through the centuries paints a vivid picture of the evolution of golf, from a simple shepherd's pastime to a beloved international sport.",

These systems are crucial in providing the necessary resources and maintaining a habitable environment for astronauts. \n\nThe first aspect covered in this section is human physiological and metabolic needs. It explains that crew members require approximately 5 kilograms of food, water, and oxygen per day, and produce waste solids, waste liquids, and carbon dioxide in similar amounts. The section emphasizes the importance of maintaining a balance in these metabolic parameters and mentions that water consumption during space missions is typically double the given value due to non-biological use. It also highlights the impact of environmental factors such as radiation, gravity, noise, vibration, and lighting on human physiological response in outer space.\n\nThe next aspect discussed is the atmosphere. Outer space life-support systems maintain atmospheres composed of oxygen, water vapor, and carbon dioxide. However, the elimination of diluent gases increases fire risks, so most modern crewed spacecraft use conventional air (nitrogen/oxygen) atmospheres. The section also mentions the potential risks of high oxygen concentrations and oxygen toxicity.\n\nWater is another crucial resource addressed in this section. It explains that water is consumed by crew members for drinking, cleaning activities, thermal control during extravehicular activity (EVA), and emergency uses. Since there are no on-site sources of water in outer space, efficient storage, usage, and reclamation systems are necessary. The section mentions the possibility of utilizing water sourced from lunar ices or Martian atmospheres or ice deposits in future missions.\n\nFood supply is also discussed, highlighting that all space missions to date have relied on supplied food. The section mentions the potential of plant cultivation systems to grow food within spacecraft, which would also regenerate water and oxygen. However, implementing such systems has been challenging due to logistical and area requirements.\n\nThe section then explores the impact of gravity on astronauts' health. Depending on the mission duration, artificial gravity may be necessary to mitigate the effects of space adaptation syndrome, body fluid redistribution, and loss of bone and muscle mass. Two methods of generating artificial weight in outer space are discussed: linear acceleration and rotation. The section explains the principles behind these methods and highlights their advantages and potential challenges.\n\nLastly, the section briefly touches upon space vehicle systems and space station systems. It mentions the different atmospheric compositions used in American spacecraft such as Gemini, Mercury, Apollo, and the Space Shuttle. It also provides examples of life-support systems used in the Soyuz spacecraft and the Bigelow Commercial Space Station. The section concludes by mentioning the concept of natural life-support systems, which have been tested for future space travel or colonization, and experimental life-support systems such as MELiSSA and CyBLiSS.\n\nOverall, this section provides a comprehensive overview of the life-support systems required for human survival in outer space. It covers the physiological and metabolic needs of astronauts, the importance of maintaining a suitable atmosphere, the challenges of water and food supply, the impact of gravity on human health, and the different systems used in space vehicles and space stations."}]

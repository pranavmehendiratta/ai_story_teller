When underwater, objects are less visible due to lower levels of natural illumination and light scattering, resulting in lower contrast. These effects vary depending on the wavelength of light, color and turbidity of the water. The vertebrate eye is usually optimized for either underwater or air vision, and the difference in refractive index between air and water can severely affect visual acuity when immersed in water. To compensate for this, an airspace is created between the cornea and the water by wearing a diving mask, which helps to reduce scale and distance distortion.\n\nFocus is another important aspect of underwater vision. Water has a different refractive index than air, which affects the focusing of the eye. Most animals' eyes are adapted to either underwater or air vision and do not focus properly when in the other environment. For example, fish have extremely convex lenses that enable proper focusing of light rays underwater. Humans, on the other hand, can see clearly underwater by wearing a flat diving mask that separates the eyes from the surrounding water with a layer of air. However, wearing a flat mask can cause objects underwater to appear 33% bigger and 25% closer than they actually are, and can also result in pincushion distortion and lateral chromatic aberration.\n\nColor vision is also affected by water. Water absorbs different frequencies of light, with red light being preferentially absorbed, followed by yellow, green, and violet light. As a result, the color that is least absorbed by water is blue light. The presence of particulates and dissolved materials in the water can further affect color absorption and result in different colors at different depths. Visibility, which refers to the ability to detect objects in the water, is influenced by factors such as illumination, length of the light path, scattering particles, dissolved pigments, and salinity and temperature gradients. Visibility can be measured using instruments such as transmissometers and nephelometers, and the standard measurement is the distance at which a Secchi disc can be seen.\n\nUnderstanding underwater vision is crucial for snorkelers and divers as it allows them to navigate and explore the underwater world effectively. By considering factors such as focus, color vision, and visibility, snorkelers and divers can make informed decisions about equipment and techniques to enhance their underwater experience."}]

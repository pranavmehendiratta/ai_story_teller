NOTES:
(2.5). Maybe need another step which rates the contents of the wikipedia document to the relevance with the topic (1 - 10) and why? which will help in find the most relevant articles. Basically, sort all the documents based on relevance and then given the length of the summary take a set of documents. For instance, it could be 10 document for 20 mins, 20 documents for 30 mins etc.

(2.8). Need to test what the website and pdf loaders 

(2.9). Maybe need to add another chain that cleans up the metadata from the document (could be useful for both wikipeida and uploaded documents)

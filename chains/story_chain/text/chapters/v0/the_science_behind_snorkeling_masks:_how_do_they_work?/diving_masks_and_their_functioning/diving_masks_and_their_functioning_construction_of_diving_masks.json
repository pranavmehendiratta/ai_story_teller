Diving masks come in different types, including half masks and full face masks. The focus of this section is on half masks, which cover the eyes and nose. These masks typically have a single, durable, tempered glass faceplate or two lenses in front of the eyes. The lenses may be supported by a plastic or metal frame or permanently bonded to the skirt in a frameless design. In some cases, such as with freediving masks, the lenses may be made of polycarbonate plastic to minimize the internal volume of the mask.\n\nThe skirt of the diving mask is usually made of synthetic rubber or silicone elastomer. It serves two important functions: creating a watertight seal with the diver's face and enclosing the nose. The nose pocket allows the diver to exhale through the nose into the mask, equalizing the internal pressure during descent and avoiding barotrauma. The mask is held in place by an elastomer strap or an expanded neoprene pad with Velcro straps. The strap is usually wider at the back or split into an upper and lower strap for stability and comfort.\n\nAnother important feature of diving masks is the purge valve. While not as common as before, some masks have a one-way purge valve under the nose to let water out. However, these valves were found to be unnecessary and unreliable, often leading to leaks. Therefore, they are not commonly used in modern diving masks.\n\nOverall, the construction of diving masks is designed to provide a comfortable and watertight fit, allowing divers to see clearly underwater. The materials used, such as tempered glass and synthetic rubber or silicone elastomer, ensure durability and flexibility. The design of the mask, including the shape of the lenses and the skirt, is optimized to minimize distortion and provide a wide field of vision. The strap and seal are adjustable to accommodate different head sizes and ensure a secure fit. In the next section, we will explore how to properly use and maintain diving masks to ensure optimal performance and longevity."}]

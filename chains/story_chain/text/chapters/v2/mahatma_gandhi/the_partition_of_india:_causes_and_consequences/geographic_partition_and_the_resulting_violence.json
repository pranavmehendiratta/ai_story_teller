The partition was outlined in the Indian Independence Act 1947, which divided British India into two independent dominions: India and Pakistan. The division of the provinces of Bengal and Punjab, which had majority Muslim districts awarded to Pakistan and majority non-Muslim districts awarded to India, led to large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration between the two dominions. It is estimated that between 14 million and 18 million people moved, and excess mortality during this period is believed to have been around one million. The violent nature of the partition created an atmosphere of hostility and suspicion between India and Pakistan that continues to affect their relationship to this day. The partition also had consequences for other political entities and transformations in the region, such as the political integration of princely states into the two new dominions and the annexation of certain territories by India."}]

                    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi": "The early life and background of Mahatma Gandhi played a significant role in shaping his later activism and leadership in the Indian independence movement. Born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, Gujarat, Gandhi was raised in a Hindu family and received his education in India and London. After completing his law studies in London, Gandhi moved to South Africa in 1893, where he first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights. It was during his time in South Africa that Gandhi developed his political and ethical principles, which would later guide his actions in India.\n\nReturning to India in 1915, Gandhi quickly became involved in organizing peasants, farmers, and urban laborers to protest against land-tax and discrimination. He assumed leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921 and led nationwide campaigns for various social and political reforms, including easing poverty, expanding women's rights, and ending untouchability. Gandhi's adoption of the dhoti and his commitment to a simple lifestyle, including self-sufficiency and fasting, became symbols of his identification with India's rural poor.\n\nGandhi's most notable acts of resistance against British rule in India include the Dandi Salt March in 1930, where he led a 400 km march to challenge the British-imposed salt tax, and the Quit India movement in 1942, where he called for the British to leave India. Throughout his activism, Gandhi was imprisoned multiple times, both in South Africa and India.\n\nGandhi's vision of an independent India based on religious pluralism faced challenges in the 1940s with the rise of Muslim nationalism, which demanded a separate homeland for Muslims within British India. Despite these challenges, Gandhi continued to advocate for peace and unity among different religious and ethnic groups. His efforts to alleviate religious violence and his numerous hunger strikes to promote peace and nonviolence further solidified his role as a leader and advocate for the Indian people.\n\nTragically, Gandhi's life was cut short when he was assassinated by a Hindu nationalist in 1948. However, his legacy as the Father of the Nation in post-colonial India and his contributions to the Indian independence movement continue to be celebrated and remembered to this day."

After completing his law studies in London, Gandhi moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit. It was in South Africa that Gandhi first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights. He experienced firsthand the racial discrimination faced by Indians and became determined to fight for their rights.\n\nIn South Africa, Gandhi raised a family and spent 21 years fighting for the rights of Indians. He organized protests against excessive land-tax and discrimination, and his efforts led to the formation of the Natal Indian Congress in 1894. Gandhi's time in South Africa also saw him actively participating in the Boer War, where he formed a volunteer ambulance corps and served as a stretcher-bearer.\n\nGandhi's experiences in South Africa shaped his beliefs and methods of resistance.

He assumed leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921 and began advocating for the rights of peasants, farmers, and urban laborers. Gandhi's approach to activism was based on nonviolent resistance, which he believed was the most effective way to bring about social and political change.\n\nOne of Gandhi's most significant contributions to the independence movement was his leadership in the Salt March in 1930. This march, which covered a distance of 400 km, was a protest against the British-imposed salt tax. Gandhi and his followers walked to the coastal town of Dandi, where they made their own salt from seawater, in defiance of the British monopoly on salt production. The Salt March gained widespread attention and inspired people across India to join the movement for independence.\n\nGandhi's vision of an independent India was based on religious pluralism and equality. However, his vision was challenged by the rise of Muslim nationalism in the 1940s, which demanded a separate homeland for Muslims within British India. Despite this challenge, Gandhi continued to advocate for unity and religious harmony. He undertook several hunger strikes to stop religious violence and visited areas affected by the partition of India in 1947, attempting to alleviate distress and promote peace.\n\nGandhi's commitment to nonviolence and his tireless efforts to achieve independence for India made him a revered figure both in India and around the world. His birthday, October 2nd, is celebrated as Gandhi Jayanti in India and the International Day of Nonviolence worldwide.

The movement during this time was characterized by the adoption of Gandhi's policy of non-violence and civil disobedience by the Indian National Congress. Gandhi's ideology of non-violence and his emphasis on truth and morality resonated with many Indians, and he became a symbol of hope and inspiration for the freedom struggle.\n\nGandhi's leadership and his ability to mobilize the masses were instrumental in the success of the non-cooperation movement.

The movement gained widespread support and participation from people across different regions and social backgrounds.\n\nGandhi's role in the freedom struggle extended beyond his leadership in the non-cooperation movement. He advocated for the rights of Indian women and promoted their participation in the freedom struggle. He also emphasized the importance of education and self-sufficiency for the empowerment of Indians. Gandhi's emphasis on communal harmony and his efforts to bridge the gap between Hindus and Muslims were also significant in a time of growing religious tensions.\n\nDespite facing opposition and repression from the British authorities, Gandhi's non-violent resistance and his unwavering commitment to truth and justice inspired millions of Indians to join the struggle for independence. His leadership and his philosophy of non-violence continue to be revered and celebrated in India and around the world."

                    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyagraha": "The principles and practice of Satyagraha, as developed by Mahatma Gandhi, played a crucial role in the Indian independence movement. Gandhi saw Satyagraha not only as a tactic for political struggle, but as a universal solution for injustice and harm. He established the Sabarmati Ashram to teach Satyagraha and outlined several principles for its practitioners. These principles included nonviolence, truth, non-stealing, non-possession, body-labour, control of desires, fearlessness, equal respect for all religions, and economic strategies such as boycotts of imported goods.\n\nGandhi also proposed a set of rules for Satyagraha campaigns. These rules emphasized the importance of non-retaliation, voluntary submission to arrest or confiscation of property, defense of property through non-violent means, and respectful behavior even as a prisoner. Gandhi believed that Satyagraha required discipline and training, and that satyagrahis must appreciate and tolerate the laws of the state, even when inconvenient. They must also be willing to endure suffering and loss for the sake of their cause.\n\nThe term \"Satyagraha\" was coined by Gandhi himself, derived from the Sanskrit words \"satya\" meaning truth and \"agraha\" meaning insistence or holding firmly to. Gandhi believed that Satyagraha went beyond passive resistance and became a force born out of truth and love. He emphasized the importance of means and ends being inseparable, rejecting the idea that injustice could be fought with unjust means or violence. Satyagraha sought to eliminate antagonisms without harming the antagonists themselves, aiming to transform relationships rather than destroy them.\n\nThe principles and practice of Satyagraha influenced many other movements of nonviolence and civil resistance, including the American Civil Rights Movement. Martin Luther King Jr. was deeply inspired by Gandhi's campaigns of nonviolent resistance and saw the potency of love and nonviolence in social reform. Gandhi also applied the concept of Satyagraha to combat oppression and genocide, suggesting that suffering voluntarily undergone could bring inner strength and joy.\n\nOverall, Satyagraha played a significant role in the Indian independence movement and continues to inspire movements for social justice and nonviolent resistance around the world. Gandhi's principles and practices of Satyagraha provided a powerful framework for challenging injustice and promoting truth, love, and nonviolence."

                    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_resistance": "In the section on 'Nonviolent resistance and its revolutionary potential', the chapter explores the concept of nonviolent resistance and its significance in achieving social change and revolution. Nonviolent resistance refers to the practice of using symbolic protests, civil disobedience, and other methods to bring about desired changes without resorting to violence or the threat of violence. It is a means for individuals or groups to express their dissatisfaction with the current conditions and strive for improvement.\n\nThe chapter highlights the distinction between nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience. While civil disobedience involves intentionally violating the law and accepting punitive measures from the state, nonviolent resistance does not necessarily require these criteria. Nonviolent resistance can have revolutionary aims, challenging the authority of the government and seeking broader systemic change. The chapter argues that civil disobedience is typically aimed at reform, while nonviolent resistance can have more transformative goals.\n\nMahatma Gandhi is recognized as one of the most prominent figures associated with nonviolent resistance. His birthday, October 2, is celebrated as the International Day of Non-Violence by the United Nations. The chapter also mentions other advocates of nonviolent resistance, including Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela, and Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa, among many others.\n\nThe chapter further discusses the role of nonviolent resistance in historical events, such as the \"Singing revolution\" in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, which led to their independence from the Soviet Union. It also highlights the diffusion of nonviolent activism across countries, where information on nonviolent resistance in one country can significantly impact movements in other countries.\n\nVarious tactics are employed in nonviolent resistance, including marches, vigils, protests, civil disobedience, boycotts, and strikes. These methods have been adopted by movements promoting nonviolence or pacifism as effective ways to achieve social or political goals. However, the chapter acknowledges that even nonviolent movements may be perceived as violent by segments of society that disagree with their goals.\n\nOverall, this section of the chapter emphasizes the power and potential of nonviolent resistance in bringing about social change and revolution. It highlights the distinction between nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience, the historical examples of successful nonviolent movements, and the various tactics employed in nonviolent resistance."

The movement was a response to the failure of the British government to secure Indian support for the British war effort with the Cripps Mission. In his Quit India speech delivered in Bombay, Gandhi called for \"An Orderly British Withdrawal\" from India and made a call to Do or Die.\n\nThe movement was met with strong opposition from the British government, who swiftly arrested almost the entire leadership of the Indian National Congress without trial. The British had the support of various groups, including the Viceroy's Council, the All India Muslim League, the Hindu Mahasabha, the princely states, the Indian Imperial Police, the British Indian Army, and the Indian Civil Service. Many Indian businessmen who were profiting from wartime spending also did not support the movement.\n\nDespite the arrests and opposition, the Quit India Movement gained momentum and included boycotting the British government and rejecting transactions involving the government. Violent incidents took place across the country against the British regime. The British responded by arresting tens of thousands of leaders and keeping them imprisoned until 1945.\n\nThe movement ultimately ended in 1945 with the release of jailed freedom fighters. The martyrs of this freedom movement include Mukunda Kakati, Matangini Hazra, Kanaklata Barua, Kushal Konwar, Bhogeswari Phukanani, and others. In 1992, the Reserve Bank of India issued a 1 rupee commemorative coin to mark the Golden Jubilee of the Quit India Movement.\n\nThe Quit India Movement had a significant impact on the Indian independence struggle. It kept the Congress party united and galvanized large protests and demonstrations across the country. The British responded with mass detentions, fines, and violence, but the movement continued to gain support. The movement also led to the establishment of parallel governments in some areas and disrupted British military preparations during World War II.\n\nThe movement ended with the release of political prisoners in 1945, and the British government realized that India was ungovernable in the long run. The issue for the postwar era became how to exit gracefully and peacefully. The Quit India Movement played a crucial role in shaping the path towards Indian independence."

The march lasted for twenty-four days, from 12 March to 5 April 1930, and was a direct action campaign against the British salt monopoly and tax resistance. It also served as a strong inauguration for the Civil Disobedience Movement, inspiring more people to follow Gandhi's example.\n\nGandhi began the march with 78 trusted volunteers from Sabarmati Ashram to Dandi, covering a distance of 387 kilometers. Along the way, more and more Indians joined the march, swelling the numbers. On 6 April 1930, Gandhi broke the British salt laws by making salt through evaporation at Dandi, sparking large-scale acts of civil disobedience against the salt laws by millions of Indians. He continued southward along the coast, making salt and addressing meetings, while the Congress Party planned a satyagraha at the Dharasana Salt Works.\n\nHowever, Gandhi was arrested on the midnight of 4-5 May 1930, just days before the planned action at Dharasana. The Dandi March and the subsequent Dharasana Satyagraha gained worldwide attention through extensive newspaper and newsreel coverage, drawing attention to the Indian independence movement. The satyagraha against the salt tax continued for almost a year, ending with Gandhi's release from jail and negotiations with Viceroy Lord Irwin at the Second Round Table Conference. Although over 60,000 Indians were jailed as a result of the Salt Satyagraha, the British did not make immediate major concessions.\n\nThe Salt Satyagraha campaign was based on Gandhi's principles of nonviolent protest called satyagraha, which means \"truth-force\" in Sanskrit. Gandhi chose the salt tax as the first target of satyagraha because it was a daily necessity for all Indians and represented the exploitation of the masses by the British. The Salt March and the subsequent Dharasana Satyagraha demonstrated the effective use of civil disobedience as a technique for fighting against social and political injustice.\n\nThe impact of the Salt March was significant, both in India and internationally. It inspired millions of Indians to join the civil disobedience movement and brought attention to the Indian independence movement worldwide. The march also had a lasting influence on American civil rights activists like Martin Luther King Jr., who drew inspiration from Gandhi's nonviolent methods in their fight for civil rights in the 1960s. Overall, the Salt March and the Civil Disobedience Movement played a crucial role in the struggle for Indian independence and paved the way for future movements and negotiations with the British government."

The province of Bengal was divided into two separate entities - Bengal and Eastern Bengal and Assam. The partition was met with widespread protests and opposition from the Bengali Hindu intelligentsia, who saw it as a ploy to weaken their influence in the region.\n\nThe partition of Bengal led to the emergence of a more radical approach towards self-rule. It sparked a wave of patriotic awareness and mobilization among the people of Bengal. Intellectuals such as Aurobindo Ghosh, Bhupendranath Datta, and Bipin Chandra Pal began writing virulent newspaper articles challenging the legitimacy of British rule in India. They were charged with sedition and arrested.\n\nThe partition of Bengal also gave rise to the Jugantar movement, a paramilitary organization led by Barindra Ghosh.

The violent nature of the partition created an atmosphere of hostility and suspicion between India and Pakistan that affects their relationship to this day.\n\nThe partition also solidified the belief among refugees that safety lay among co-religionists. The migrations were driven by the desire to be with people of the same religious background, as the partition was based on religious lines. This belief in the need for a separate homeland for Muslims in Pakistan became palpable during the partition.\n\nThe partition of Bengal was not without its controversies and challenges. The division of Bengal was met with protests and opposition from the Hindu elite of Bengal, who felt that the partition was punishment for their political assertiveness.

It is estimated that between 14 million and 18 million people moved, and excess mortality during this period is believed to have been around one million. The violent nature of the partition created an atmosphere of hostility and suspicion between India and Pakistan that continues to affect their relationship to this day. The partition also had consequences for other political entities and transformations in the region, such as the political integration of princely states into the two new dominions and the annexation of certain territories by India."

The march lasted for twenty-four days, from 12 March to 5 April 1930, and was a direct action campaign against the British salt monopoly and tax resistance. It also served as a strong inauguration for the Civil Disobedience Movement, inspiring more people to follow Gandhi's example.\n\nGandhi began the march with 78 trusted volunteers from Sabarmati Ashram to Dandi, covering a distance of 387 kilometers. Along the way, more and more Indians joined the march, swelling the numbers. On 6 April 1930, Gandhi broke the British salt laws by making salt through evaporation at Dandi, sparking large-scale acts of civil disobedience against the salt laws by millions of Indians. He continued southward along the coast, making salt and addressing meetings, while the Congress Party planned a satyagraha at the Dharasana Salt Works.\n\nHowever, Gandhi was arrested on the midnight of 4-5 May 1930, just days before the planned action at Dharasana. The Dandi March and the subsequent Dharasana Satyagraha gained worldwide attention through extensive newspaper and newsreel coverage, drawing attention to the Indian independence movement. The satyagraha against the salt tax continued for almost a year, ending with Gandhi's release from jail and negotiations with Viceroy Lord Irwin at the Second Round Table Conference. Although over 60,000 Indians were jailed as a result of the Salt Satyagraha, the British did not make immediate major concessions.\n\nThe Salt Satyagraha campaign was based on Gandhi's principles of nonviolent protest called satyagraha, which means \"truth-force\" in Sanskrit. Gandhi chose the salt tax as the first target of satyagraha because it was a daily necessity for all Indians and represented the exploitation of the masses by the British. The Salt March and the subsequent Dharasana Satyagraha demonstrated the effective use of civil disobedience as a technique for fighting against social and political injustice.\n\nThe impact of the Salt March was significant, both in India and internationally. It inspired millions of Indians to join the civil disobedience movement and brought attention to the Indian independence movement worldwide. The march also had a lasting influence on American civil rights activists like Martin Luther King Jr., who drew inspiration from Gandhi's nonviolent methods in their fight for civil rights in the 1960s. Overall, the Salt March and the Civil Disobedience Movement played a crucial role in the struggle for Indian independence and paved the way for future movements and negotiations with the British government."}]

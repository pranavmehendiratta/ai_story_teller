Gandhi saw Satyagraha not only as a tactic for political struggle, but as a universal solution for injustice and harm. He established the Sabarmati Ashram to teach Satyagraha and outlined several principles for its practitioners. These principles included nonviolence, truth, non-stealing, non-possession, body-labour, control of desires, fearlessness, equal respect for all religions, and economic strategies such as boycotts of imported goods.\n\nGandhi also proposed a set of rules for Satyagraha campaigns. These rules emphasized the importance of non-retaliation, voluntary submission to arrest or confiscation of property, defense of property through non-violent means, and respectful behavior even as a prisoner. Gandhi believed that Satyagraha required discipline and training, and that satyagrahis must appreciate and tolerate the laws of the state, even when inconvenient. They must also be willing to endure suffering and loss for the sake of their cause.\n\nThe term \"Satyagraha\" was coined by Gandhi himself, derived from the Sanskrit words \"satya\" meaning truth and \"agraha\" meaning insistence or holding firmly to. Gandhi believed that Satyagraha went beyond passive resistance and became a force born out of truth and love. He emphasized the importance of means and ends being inseparable, rejecting the idea that injustice could be fought with unjust means or violence. Satyagraha sought to eliminate antagonisms without harming the antagonists themselves, aiming to transform relationships rather than destroy them.\n\nThe principles and practice of Satyagraha influenced many other movements of nonviolence and civil resistance, including the American Civil Rights Movement. Martin Luther King Jr. was deeply inspired by Gandhi's campaigns of nonviolent resistance and saw the potency of love and nonviolence in social reform. Gandhi also applied the concept of Satyagraha to combat oppression and genocide, suggesting that suffering voluntarily undergone could bring inner strength and joy.\n\nOverall, Satyagraha played a significant role in the Indian independence movement and continues to inspire movements for social justice and nonviolent resistance around the world. Gandhi's principles and practices of Satyagraha provided a powerful framework for challenging injustice and promoting truth, love, and nonviolence."}]

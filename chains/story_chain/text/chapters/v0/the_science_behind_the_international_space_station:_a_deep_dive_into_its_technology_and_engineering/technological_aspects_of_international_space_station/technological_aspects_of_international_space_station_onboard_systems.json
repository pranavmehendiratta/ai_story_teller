This section covers the life support systems, atmospheric control systems, power and thermal control, and communications and computers on board the ISS.\n\nThe life support systems are crucial for maintaining a habitable environment for astronauts in outer space. These systems provide the necessary resources such as food, water, and oxygen, while also managing waste and maintaining a balance in metabolic parameters. The section highlights the physiological and metabolic needs of crew members, the importance of maintaining a suitable atmosphere, the challenges of water and food supply, and the impact of gravity on human health.\n\nThe atmospheric control systems on the ISS ensure that the atmosphere is similar to that of Earth, providing crew comfort and safety. These systems generate oxygen and remove carbon dioxide and other by-products of human metabolism. The section explains the different methods used to maintain the atmosphere and the potential risks associated with high oxygen concentrations.\n\nPower and thermal control systems are essential for the operation of the ISS. The station is powered by solar arrays that provide electrical power, which is then distributed and converted to the required voltage. The section explains the use of solar arrays, batteries, and cooling systems to manage power and thermal control on the ISS.\n\nCommunications and computers play a crucial role in the operation and coordination of activities on the ISS. The section discusses the communication systems used for telemetry, scientific data links, audio and video communication, and internet access. It also explains the use of computers for various tasks and the operating systems used on the ISS.\n\nOverall, this section provides a comprehensive overview of the onboard systems of the ISS, highlighting the technological aspects that enable the functioning and survival of astronauts in outer space."}]

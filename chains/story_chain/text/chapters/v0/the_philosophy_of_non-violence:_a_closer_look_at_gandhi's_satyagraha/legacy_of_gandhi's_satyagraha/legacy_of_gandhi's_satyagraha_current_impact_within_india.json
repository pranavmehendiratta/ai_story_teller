Despite India's rapid economic modernization and urbanization, Gandhi's politics continue to be revered in the country. His vision of a village-dominated economy may have been rejected, but his call for a national ethos of personal austerity and nonviolence is still respected. Gandhi's birthday, October 2nd, is celebrated as a national holiday in India known as Gandhi Jayanti. His date of death, January 30th, is commemorated as Martyrs' Day. \n\nGandhi's influence is also evident in the presence of temples and memorials dedicated to him in India. There are three temples in the country dedicated to Gandhi, located in Sambalpur, Odisha, Nidaghatta village near Kadur in Chikmagalur district of Karnataka, and Chityal in the district of Nalgonda, Telangana. The Gandhi Memorial in Kanyakumari and the Tamukkam or Summer Palace in Madurai also serve as important landmarks associated with Gandhi's legacy.\n\nGandhi's descendants, including his children and grandchildren, continue to live in India and other countries. His grandson Rajmohan Gandhi is a professor in Illinois and an author of a biography on Gandhi, while another grandson, Tarun Gandhi, has written several authoritative books on his grandfather. Despite his immense impact on India and the world, Gandhi's teachings and principles continue to inspire individuals and communities to strive for peace, justice, and equality."}]

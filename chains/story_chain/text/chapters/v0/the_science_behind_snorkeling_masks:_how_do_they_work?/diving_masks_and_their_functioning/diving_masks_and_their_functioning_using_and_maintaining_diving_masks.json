A good fit is crucial for a diving mask as it ensures a comfortable and effective seal all around the skirt, allowing for a clear field of vision without pressing on the nose or forehead underwater. Divers can test the fit of a mask by placing it on their face without using the straps and gently inhaling through their nose. If the mask stays on without any help, it indicates that the skirt is in sufficient contact with the facial skin, creating a watertight seal.\n\nFactors such as the space for the nose in the nose pocket, contact between the mask frame and the bridge of the nose, and pressure on the forehead also affect the fit of the mask. It is important to adjust the strap to suit the diver's head, ensuring it is not too loose or too tight. When entering the water, divers should be cautious of water impact that may dislodge or knock off the mask. It is recommended to either prevent water impact manually or enter the water without the mask and put it on afterwards. To prevent fogging, divers can spit into the dry mask before use, spread the saliva around the inside of the plate, and rinse it out with a little water. Standard maintenance includes rinsing the mask with clean, fresh water after each use and allowing it to dry out of direct sunlight before storage.\n\nMask removal and refitting underwater, as well as clearing, are basic skills that all divers must learn to deal with flooding, leaks, or the mask being dislodged without panic. It is common for water to leak into the mask, and divers need to be able to clear the water quickly and effectively. The methods of clearing differ between half masks and full-face masks. Half masks can be cleared by exhaling through the nose, while full-face masks require exhaling through the nose and mouth. Equalizing the mask is also essential to prevent barotrauma to the middle and inner ear. By exhaling sufficient air through the nose, divers can balance the internal pressure of the mask.\n\nOverall, understanding how to properly use and maintain diving masks is crucial for optimal performance and longevity. A well-fitted mask, along with proper maintenance and clearing techniques, ensures a comfortable and clear underwater experience for divers."}]

These systems are crucial in providing the necessary resources and maintaining a habitable environment for astronauts. \n\nThe first aspect covered in this section is human physiological and metabolic needs. It explains that crew members require approximately 5 kilograms of food, water, and oxygen per day, and produce waste solids, waste liquids, and carbon dioxide in similar amounts. The section emphasizes the importance of maintaining a balance in these metabolic parameters and mentions that water consumption during space missions is typically double the given value due to non-biological use. It also highlights the impact of environmental factors such as radiation, gravity, noise, vibration, and lighting on human physiological response in outer space.\n\nThe next aspect discussed is the atmosphere. Outer space life-support systems maintain atmospheres composed of oxygen, water vapor, and carbon dioxide. However, the elimination of diluent gases increases fire risks, so most modern crewed spacecraft use conventional air (nitrogen/oxygen) atmospheres. The section also mentions the potential risks of high oxygen concentrations and oxygen toxicity.\n\nWater is another crucial resource addressed in this section. It explains that water is consumed by crew members for drinking, cleaning activities, thermal control during extravehicular activity (EVA), and emergency uses. Since there are no on-site sources of water in outer space, efficient storage, usage, and reclamation systems are necessary. The section mentions the possibility of utilizing water sourced from lunar ices or Martian atmospheres or ice deposits in future missions.\n\nFood supply is also discussed, highlighting that all space missions to date have relied on supplied food. The section mentions the potential of plant cultivation systems to grow food within spacecraft, which would also regenerate water and oxygen. However, implementing such systems has been challenging due to logistical and area requirements.\n\nThe section then explores the impact of gravity on astronauts' health. Depending on the mission duration, artificial gravity may be necessary to mitigate the effects of space adaptation syndrome, body fluid redistribution, and loss of bone and muscle mass. Two methods of generating artificial weight in outer space are discussed: linear acceleration and rotation. The section explains the principles behind these methods and highlights their advantages and potential challenges.\n\nLastly, the section briefly touches upon space vehicle systems and space station systems. It mentions the different atmospheric compositions used in American spacecraft such as Gemini, Mercury, Apollo, and the Space Shuttle. It also provides examples of life-support systems used in the Soyuz spacecraft and the Bigelow Commercial Space Station. The section concludes by mentioning the concept of natural life-support systems, which have been tested for future space travel or colonization, and experimental life-support systems such as MELiSSA and CyBLiSS.\n\nOverall, this section provides a comprehensive overview of the life-support systems required for human survival in outer space. It covers the physiological and metabolic needs of astronauts, the importance of maintaining a suitable atmosphere, the challenges of water and food supply, the impact of gravity on human health, and the different systems used in space vehicles and space stations."

                        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input-to-state_stability_part_1": "Input-to-state stability (ISS) is a stability notion widely used to study the stability of nonlinear control systems with external inputs. It is a property that characterizes the behavior of a control system in the presence of disturbances or uncertainties. In ISS, a control system is globally asymptotically stable in the absence of external inputs and its trajectories are bounded by a function of the size of the input for all sufficiently large times.\n\nThe importance of ISS lies in its ability to bridge the gap between input-output and state-space methods, which are widely used in the control systems community. It unifies the Lyapunov and input-output stability theories and revolutionizes our view on stabilization of nonlinear systems, design of robust nonlinear observers, stability of nonlinear interconnected control systems, nonlinear detectability theory, and supervisory adaptive control. ISS has become the dominating stability paradigm in nonlinear control theory, with applications in robotics, mechatronics, systems biology, electrical and aerospace engineering, among others.\n\nIn this section, we will discuss the definition of ISS and its characterizations. ISS is defined for a time-invariant system of ordinary differential equations with external inputs. It is a property that ensures the system is globally asymptotically stable in the absence of external inputs and its trajectories are bounded by a function of the size of the input for all sufficiently large times. The definition of ISS is based on the concept of comparison functions, which are continuous increasing functions that bound the trajectories of the system.\n\nWe will also discuss the characterizations of the input-to-state stability property. These characterizations provide alternative ways to check whether a system is ISS. One of the characterizations is based on the notion of globally asymptotic stability (GAS), which states that a system is ISS if it is globally asymptotically stable at zero and its trajectories are bounded by a function of the size of the input. Another characterization is based on the concept of Lyapunov gain, which measures the rate at which the Lyapunov function decreases along the trajectories of the system.\n\nIn addition to the definition and characterizations, we will also discuss ISS-Lyapunov functions, which are important tools for verifying ISS. An ISS-Lyapunov function is a smooth function that satisfies certain conditions and provides a measure of the system's stability. It is used to establish the stability of the system by showing that the derivative of the Lyapunov function is negative along the trajectories of the system.\n\nFurthermore, we will explore the interconnections of ISS systems. One of the main features of the ISS framework is the ability to study the stability properties of interconnected systems. We will discuss cascade interconnections, where the dynamics of the subsystems do not depend on the states of the other subsystems. We will also discuss feedback interconnections, where the interconnection structure of the subsystems is characterized by the internal Lyapunov gains. We will present a small-gain theorem that provides a sufficient condition for ISS of the interconnection of ISS systems.\n\nFinally, we will touch upon ISS of time-delay systems and ISS of other classes of systems. ISS theory has been extended to time-delay systems, where the state of the system depends on past values of the input and the state. We will discuss the conditions for ISS of time-delay systems and the different Lyapunov-type sufficient conditions that have been proposed. We will also briefly mention the ISS theory for other classes of systems, such as time-variant ordinary differential equation systems and hybrid systems.\n\nIn conclusion, input-to-state stability is a powerful stability notion that has revolutionized the field of nonlinear control theory. It provides a unified framework for studying the stability of nonlinear control systems with external inputs and has diverse applications in various fields of engineering. The definition, characterizations, and interconnections of ISS systems provide valuable tools for analyzing and designing stable control systems. The ISS theory for time-delay systems and other classes of systems further extends the applicability of ISS to a wide range of practical systems."

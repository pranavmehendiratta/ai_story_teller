His father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi, served as the dewan (chief minister) of Porbandar state.

His mother's piety and devotion to prayer deeply influenced Gandhi, who admired her ability to keep the hardest vows without flinching. At the age of nine, Gandhi entered a local school in Rajkot, where he studied the rudiments of arithmetic, history, the Gujarati language, and geography.
